## About The Project
Cardiac conditions like stroke and coronary artery disease remain a huge health risk for millions of patients around the world. Medical history, genetic, poor lifestyles and dietary choices are all factors that can edge an individual closer to danger. Early detection is critical to the successful treatment of heart diseases, yet access to healthcare is often limited. This projects aims to bridge the gap to personal healthcare through predictive ML models, ensuring that everyone is only a few clicks away from the help they need.

### Beyond the predictions: Helping users build healthier lifestyles
While predicting cardiac risks lies at its core, this project hopes to reach beyond providing users with precise results. AI is further leveraged to provide personalized, actionable insights for users to improve their cardiac health. By providing personalized recommendations and resources on lifestyle adjustments, diet plans, and stress management strategies, users will be equipped with a roadmap towards positive change, and the tools to complete their transformation.
